''' Desription: Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a
                measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension
                four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.

                measure_runtime should measure the total runtime and return it.
                Notice that the total runtime is roughly 10 seconds, explain
                it to yourself.
